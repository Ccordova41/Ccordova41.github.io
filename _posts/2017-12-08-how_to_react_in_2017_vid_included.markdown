Going through the Full stack web development v3 track, I was always grateful for “aha” moments. You know the moments I'm talking about... those moments where things just make sense, without having to go rummaging through stack overflow answers and youtube videos(I must say however, that I really have learned to enjoy watching Youtube videos of coding projects and coding along🤓 ).

Luckily, in the React portion of the course, I’ve had many of these “aha” moments, which is awesome motivation! The ease of picking up React has come as a pleasant surprise.

*For those who are unfamiliar with React, it is a  declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.*

Since I've picked up the habit of watching Youtube videos on almost every subject, I made sure to do the same for React.
Here are a couple of videos that have made me have all of these “aha” moments for React.
