Within my last portfolio project( an awesome React project about [Doctor Who](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0)), I channeled in the power of mapDispatchToProps. 

I needed to add the createReport action to the props of the ReportForm component by way of mapDispatchToProps and connect.

 â€˜Connectâ€™  basically connects the component(in my case, ReportForm) to the redux store. By including the â€˜mapDispatchToPropsâ€™ function as an argument, Iâ€™m allowing this component to have access to this specific part of the redux store. 
Now to further explain MapDispatchToProps; it is the useful means that redux provides to dispatching actions from my component to the store(so it is updated). In addition, we use the â€˜bindActionCreatorsâ€™ which maps the action function to an object using the names of the action functions(in my case, that is â€˜createReportâ€™. These functions automatically dispatch the action to the store when the function is called(in my code, this action is called on by â€˜handleOnSubmit)â€™.
