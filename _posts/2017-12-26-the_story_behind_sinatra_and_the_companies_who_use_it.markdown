Sinatra is a nifty free and open source software web application library written in Ruby ![](https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/fugue/icon_shadowless/ruby.png). It was designed and created by Blake Mizerany in 2007.

It doesn't follow the usual MVC pattern used in other frameworks, because it focuses on creating awesome web-application as quickly as possible. 

It's such light-weight and easy to use that many companies utilize it. Companies like: 

* Apple
* BBC
* LinkedIn
* National Security Agency 
* Heroku 
* GitHub 
* the British Government's Government Digital Service 

For me, it's very important to see what things have been created using a framework or a language. Seeing that companies like Apple and BBC use Sinatra definetly gives me some confidence in utilizeing this tool. 

For more information about applications that have been built with Sinatra, look at the site below!!
