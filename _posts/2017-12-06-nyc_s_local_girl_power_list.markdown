Itâ€™s no surprise that in the city that never sleeps, thereâ€™s going to be a plethora of Tech companies producing amazing products, services, and experiences (i.e- https://vrworldnyc.com/). This is GREAT news for all FlatIron students in NYC looking at the career siteâ€™s of these companies.  

After going through many lists with the names of the top 50 companies to work for in the tech industry, the top tech companies with the coolest office, etc.., I made a list of my very own. These companies are run by fierce ladies, who are making a difference, one â€˜stringâ€™ at a time. 


ENJOY!!     https://goo.gl/maps/XthtU5CXpGR2
