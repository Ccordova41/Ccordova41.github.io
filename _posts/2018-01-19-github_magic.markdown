One of the many things I was able to pick up while learning Ruby, was the fantastic tricks and shortcuts Github has(that I had no idea existed!).

Let’s take a look at a couple of useful ones: 

- $ git log <br> 
this one is great for the simple fact that it’ll show you the list of ALL of your commits. Basically, it shows the evolution of your project files. 

- $ git diff [first-branch]...[second-branch]<br> 
This one shows the differences between two branches. Helps when a team member(or maybe you haha) hasn't correctly documented their changes.

- $ git reset [commit]<br> 
this erases mistakes and updates the history ( I may have overused this one ). 


And there you have it! Some gems that I have picked up along my Ruby project journey. 

Happy Coding!
