React has been a great tool to learn! 

Firstly, Redux has no relation to React. You can actually write Redux apps with React, Ember, or plain ole JavaScript. 
However, there is a plus of working with React + Redux, because React lets you describe UI as a function of state, and Redux emits state updates in response to actions.

This makes things smooth and easy to learn and use right away. 

Happy Coding!
