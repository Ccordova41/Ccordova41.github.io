Starting the CLI project was an exciting moment for me as a novice developer...I was ready to **TACKLE** this project! Now that I'm all done, I'm ready to share my little truths I've learned along the way. 

**First Things First**

Like every other lab, the first thing that needs to be tackled is to fully review the README.md. To be honest, I have had moments where I just jumped into the assignment without reading the entire README.md and it has proven to be a mistake. 

This lab is packed filled with steps that must be completed, so please make sure to review the README file and take notes along the way. I created a seperate NOTES.md file to start brainstorming on project ideas and lay out my steps. 


**Walkthrough Videos, Student Examples, and Study Groups**

There are a couple of Walkthrough Videos within the Final section. I HIGHLY recommend that you watch them and then watch them again! They are there to help guide you through this project and give you a good idea on how to tackle it. 

The other resource available are the student examples. I enjoyed reviewing these because it gave me a peak into how other students create their own code. 

Last but not least, my all time favorite - Study Groups. The Learn Instructors set up study groups  that are specific to this project and they are *extremely * useful. The instructors go over the lab and answer any and all questions you may have. For example, if you're stuck on what idea you'd like to pursue for the lab, they are there to help!


Inspiration overload...


**Idea and Take Off**

The idea I chose for my CLI was to provide the user with the Top 20 Companies to Work for, based off of Fortune.com. 

The user experience I wanted to create was to provide the names of the companies and their respective ranks. From there, the user could select what company they wanted more information on. 

After the pseudocode for the CLI has been created, it's time to make some magic and build the actual interface!  


**Project is a GO**

With all of the resources and your knowledge....you are ready to go! To summarize all this awesomeness:  

**DO**
1. Read through the entire README.md file. 
2. Take notes on the specific requirements that you have to complete to pass the project. 
3. Watch all walkthrough videos (2x if necessary!) 
4. Clone and review the previous student examples. 
5. Attend Study Groups for this project. 

**DON'T**
1. Rush through this project and miss some requirements. The requirements are there to help you get 100% from this assignment. 
2. Copy word for word from the previous students' assignments. This is your opportunity to learn a little bit more! 
3. Be afraid to ask for help. The Learn instructors are there to help you brainstorm and work through your project; reach out to them if you are stuck. 


And always remember that this is a project to help you continue in your learning process as a beginner. Don't be too hard on yourself if this takes longer than expected.
 

**Extra Gold Nugget: **

This quote helped me to remember to *be kind* to myself as a beginner. Hopefully it will help you too: 

"Learning to program is hard, as is learning to do anything worthwhile when you’re just starting out. Freaking out about not knowing anything is totally normal, and every budding programmer feels overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of all that they don’t know."
