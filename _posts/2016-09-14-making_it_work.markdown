"...What is done in love is done well." 
                         - Vincent Van Gogh 

Hello everyone!! I'd like to firstly walk you through an introduction of who I am and why I'm joining the FlatIron Web Development program....then we can get on with some techie fun stuff. 

I am Catherine Cordova <small>(long name = Catherine Maria Gomez Galvez Cordova Villachica (try saying that three times!)). </small> I'm a native New Yorker that moved to Nashville, TN (inserts cowboy boots here) in February of 2016. I've had previous coding exeperience doing little websites here and there but never truly dug into it. It wasn't until I started working with UX, UI designers, and data management team at my current job, that I discovered that....I <b>really</b> like this coding thing!

SO after some restless nights, many **many** pros and cons lists, I decided to go back to school to pursue a Masters in computer engineering and an MBA. Or so I thought. 

I suddenly felt an urge to push that goal out a bit further, in regards to my timeline. Why you may ask? 

I'll fill you in on my next post! ;) 

What I can say is that I've slowly learned that whatever I am going to pursue and invest time, energy, and my passion into, I must do it with love. And I don't mean the superficial #blessed type of superificial expression; I truly mean the vibrant, continously pouring, twinkle in my eyes, determined type of love. 

As I begin this journey, I begin it with determination to succeed and make the absolute best out of this program. 


With Love,
Catherine Cordova
